# How it works
<ul>
  <li> Users are authenticated with Django's built in user authentication </li>
  <li> When a user registers, a product set is created for the Google Vision API, this product set will store all the clothing items a user adds </li>
  <li> To add a clothing item, a user must provide a name, category and image for the item, this clothing item is then added to the product set </li>
</ul>
